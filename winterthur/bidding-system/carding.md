# Carding system

We play UDCA

    - Encourage is Low and Disourage is high
    - Lanvinthal, low is switching into low suit and high into hight suit
    - Odd/Even - low we have
          ODD number of cards (3, 5, 7),
          high we have EVEN (2 4 6)

We encourage usually when a partner suppose to have a trick
Otherwise we prefer Even/Odd signals, if it cuts a table
