# Carding system

Basic Agreements for Direct Defense (Bridge)

## Opening Lead:

• From a doubleton, lead the higher card → Hh
• From a tripleton, lead the middle, then the highest → hHh
• From a longer sequence, lead the second-highest → hHhh(h)
• From third-round honor protection, lead the lowest → HhX
• From fourth-round or longer honor protection, lead the fourth-highest → HhhX(h)
• From a solid sequence, lead the highest → KQJ, 109x
• From an interior sequence, lead the highest → KJ10x, Q109x

## Signaling:

    •	Priority signal on partner’s lead: Encouragement/Discouragement
    •	Discard the lowest card if you like the lead and want a continuation (unless playing a higher card to contest the trick).
    •	Discard the highest expendable card if you want a switch to another suit.
    •	Count signals (only when useful to partner):
    •	Discard the lowest card → Even count (when ruffing, no more than 2!)
    •	Discard the highest expendable card → Odd count (when ruffing, 3 or more)
    •	Discard signals when void in the suit (Italian signals):
    •	Odd-ranking honor → Strength in the discarded suit
    •	Even low honor → Strength in the lower of the remaining suits (or neutral)
    •	Even high honor → Strength in the higher of the remaining suits
    •	Suit-preference on ruffs (Lavinthal signal):
    •	Small card → Request return in the lower remaining suit
    •	High card → Request return in the higher remaining suit
