# 1C/D/H/S overcall

Of course an overcall must be reasonable and close to solid,
no adventures, excepting 1c strong.

Everything by classical convention, except for the following:

## 1NT - Raptor overcall

We have **5 cards in Minor** and **4 cards in Major**.

Against `1 Major` (H or S) it means we have 5 cards in unknown `minor` and
4 cards in other `major`.

Against `1 Minor`, it means we have 5 cards in other `minor` and unknown 4
cards in other `major`.

One special case, we may overcall when two opponents bid two suits, it
means we show to another suit with 4 cards in higher suit

A partner response in a **minimax** manner: guessing the most suitable level
to bid.

## 55 Michaels

Everything quite classic:

    1 minor - 2 minor = 55 in Majors
    1 major - 2 major = 55 other major and minor
    1 major - 2nt = 55 in minors

Answer in minimax manner

play against NT contract
