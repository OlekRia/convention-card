# 2C Force Game opening

The 2♣ opening in this system always shows a strong hand, which can be one of three types:

    1️⃣ Balanced (21+ HCP) → Strong NT-like hands.
    2️⃣ One-Suiter (9+ tricks in a suit) → A long, strong suit (♠/♥/♦/♣).
    3️⃣ Two-Suiter (at least 5-5 wild shape, very strong) → Highly distributional hands.

In case of Wild sitributions (2 and 3 cases) we have only 4 losers in the hand

## Responder’s Responses – Control Showing

The responder answers in “Controls” (Aces = 2, Kings = 1) instead of
traditional step responses.
Responder’s Bid Control Points Meaning

    2♦    0 or 1 Controls Weak hand, 0-1 Aces/Kings
    2♥    2 Controls At least 2 Kings or 1 Ace
    2♠    3 Controls Any combination adding to 3 (1 Ace + 1 King)
    2NT   3 Controls 3 Kings

And this is really rare but possible in a wild distribution:

    2NT   4 Controls 2 Aces or 1 Ace + 2 Kings
    3♣    5 Controls 3 Aces, or 2 Aces + 1 King
    3♦+   6+ Controls 3+ Aces, or 2 Aces + multiple Kings
