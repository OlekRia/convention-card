# 2â™¦ Opening

The 2â™¦ Opening shows a self-fitting hand or an extremely unbalanced hand. The opener is responsible for determining the final suit.

Openerâ€™s Hand Types for 2â™¦ Opening: 1. Self-fitting hand â€“ The opener already knows the trump suit. 2. Extremely unbalanced â€“ Two-suited hands like 6-6, 6-5-1-1, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ We typically play a suit contract. NT is only considered after key-card inquiries.

Bidding Process:
â€¢ NT is only a possibility after all key cards are determined.
â€¢ We will primarily play the openerâ€™s suit, and the responder should bid the closest feasible bid to support continuation if they have no fit.
â€¢ if an Opener didnt relay and bid game or slam contract - it's a signoff, otherwife it might be searching a fit with 5-6 suits.

ðŸ”´ Drawbacks and âœ… Benefits of 2â™¦ Opening

Drawback:
â€¢ Opponents can interfere quickly with preemptive bids (e.g., 3-level or higher bids).
Benefit:
â€¢ Responder can immediately relay key cards, allowing precise slam exploration without ambiguity.

ðŸš€ KK Relay (Kit Woolsey & Karen McCallum)
After the 2â™¦ opening, responder uses KK Relay to show: 1. Aces 2. Kings 3. Queens
Each step is designed to ask about key cards to explore the possibility of a slam.

## Step 1: Asking for Aces (KK Relay Standard)

      2â™¥ 0 Aces
      2â™  1 Ace (Responder clarifies the suit later)
      2NT 2 Aces (same color CS or DH)
      3â™£ 2 Aces (minor or major CD or HS)
      3â™¦ 2 Aces (diff colors CH or DS)
      3â™¥ All 4 Aces

ðŸ’¡ If responder has 1 or 2 Aces, opener will relay again to ask for the exact
suit locations.

## Step 2 - +1 bid: Asking for Kings (KK Relay Standard)

-- 0 Kings
-- 1 King
-- 2 Kings
-- 3 Kings
-- All 4 Kings

ðŸ’¡ If responder has Kings, opener relays again to determine suit locations.

## Step 2 - +2 bid: Asking for Exact Aces

if 1 Ace - Show naturally by suit including NT whch replaces most far bids.
if 2 Aces - show in low-high order:

- colors (same color - closest is C and S and second D and H)
- maj minor
- diff color

## Step 3: Asking for Queens (Grand Slam Exploration)

-- No Queens
-- 1 Queen
-- 2 Queens
-- 3 Queens
-- All 4 Queens

ðŸ’¡ Again, suit location of Queens is determined in steps.

## Continuation after Kings

next step ask about Queens
next step + 1 = as about colors of king (if 1 or 2)

## Continuation after Queens - ask Queens colors (if 1 or 2)
